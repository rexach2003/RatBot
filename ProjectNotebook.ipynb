I found the artificial agents from A4 charming, so for this final project, I challenged myself to create a similar agent that could explore a predetermined course with intentionality. While I used the basic model from A4 as a starting point, I ended up needing to rework the structure of the bot from the ground in order to fit my idea for it."
